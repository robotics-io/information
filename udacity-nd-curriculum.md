## Udacity Robotics Nanodegree Curriculum

#### Week 1
###### Introduction to Robotics

Use fundamental computer vision techniques to navigate a simulated environment with a rover.
<br>`Project` : Search and Sample Return  (Similar to Nasa's [Sample Return Robot Competition](https://www.nasa.gov/directorates/spacetech/centennial_challenges/sample_return_robot/index.html))
<br>`Skills` : [Motion Planning](https://github.com/robotics-io/information/blob/master/skills/motion-planning.md)


#### Week 2
###### ROS Basics

Become acquainted with the core components of the ROS framework, and begin writing code that’s capable of controlling a real robot.
<br>`Project` : Turtlesim in ROS
<br>`Skills` : [ROS, Gazebo](https://github.com/robotics-io/information/blob/master/skills/ros-and-gazebo.md)


#### Week 3, 4
###### Kinematics

Develop a mathematical foundation that allows for a description of the state (position, velocity, acceleration) of a robotic arm with multiple joints and axes of rotation.
<br>`Project` : Pick and Place (After this, try [Amazon Robotics Challenge](https://www.amazonrobotics.com/#/roboticschallenge))
<br>`Skills` : [Kinematics](https://github.com/robotics-io/information/blob/master/skills/kinematics.md)


#### Week 5, 6
###### Controls

Learn the fundamentals of the algorithms used to control 95% of the world’s robots.
<br>`Project` : Drone Flight Controller
<br>`Skills` :


#### Week 7-10
###### Computer Vision

Learn Object recognition, segmentation, and how to use depth data for 3D perception. Use the Point Cloud Library (PCL) and Random Sample Consensus (RANSAC) packages to fit a model in the presence of outliers in the data.
<br>`Project` : Perception and Control
<br>`Skills` : PR2, [Computer Vision](https://github.com/robotics-io/information/blob/master/skills/computer-vision.md)
